<h1> NeIC All Hands Meeting 2016 </h1>

<p>
The NeIC All Hands Meeting (AHM) is taking place from
Monday 25th until Thursday 28th January, 2016 at Skeikampen,
Norway. The intended participants of the AHM are personnel
engaged in NeIC operations or projects. The NeIC AHM16 will
explore and nurture the ways we work together towards the
NeIC vision: <b>NeIC is global role model for cross-border
distributed and sustainable e-Infrastructure services.</b>

<p>
The <a href="program">program</a> will have a mix of plenary sessions, tutorials,
teamwork challenges and parallel project meetings. 

<p>
The <a href="program">program</a> will also include a major component of social
networking, attempting to mitigate the effects of the
completely distributed nature of NeIC and to facilitate
excellent working relations. The premises offers opportunities
for a range of outdoor activities and the hotel has a spa. 

<p>
The meeting builds on the NeIC AHM 2015, which was evaluated
as a very successful event by the participants, see
