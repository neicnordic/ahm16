== Managing virtual machines with Ganeti -- hands-on tutorial ==

Chair: [[{{ site.baseurl }}/people/wadenstein|{{ site.data.people['wadenstein'].name }}]]

[http://www.ganeti.org/ Ganeti] is a cluster virtual server management software tool built on top of 
existing virtualization technologies such as Xen or KVM and other open source 
software.

The participants will participate in hands-on installation and getting 
started, following the official Ganeti documentation and then doing a few 
example tasks that the chair will define. The tasks will be perfomed on the 
test cluster set up in advance, but the participants must use their laptops 
to connect to it.
