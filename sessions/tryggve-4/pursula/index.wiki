This session will continue planning of next steps in the Tryggve project, including how to
coordinate and collaborate with ELIXIR Excelerate project in preparing Nordic local EGA
nodes. The Steering group of the project expects to see a plan on the latter topic by their
meeting in early March. Another important topic is to discuss on new use cases
and how to upgrade activity towards potential pilot users.
