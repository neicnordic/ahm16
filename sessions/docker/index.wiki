{% include session.wiki %}

[https://www.docker.com/what-docker Docker] allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

The tutorial provides overview of the technology, and the platform components, 
followed by a hands-on training for getting started using Docker: how to 
create Dockerfiles, build, manage, distribute Docker images, and configure 
Containers. The participants need to bring their own laptops with ssh 
connection, and the basic knowledge of Linux is also a prerequisite.
