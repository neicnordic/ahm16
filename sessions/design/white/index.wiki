The NeIC EISCAT_3D Support Project (E3DS) helps the future EISCAT_3D project in planning and tendering their required e-infrastructure. 

The E3DS project aims to make it possible to expand and enhance the usage of existing Nordic e-infrastructures. By introducing a new field of research to the existing Nordic e-infrastructure the overall capabilities will be extended. 

The design of the EISCAT_3D e-infrastructure must take into account the principles of cost-effectiveness, capacity to perform the tasks, ease of use and future expansion.
