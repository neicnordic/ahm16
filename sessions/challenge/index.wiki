== Introduction ==

The objective of the two combined sessions is to work in teams
drawing members from different projects in NeIC. You'll get to
build a robot and program it to meet challenges and to compete
against the other teams.

We are planning to split all AHM participants into four teams of
equal size.

== Logistics ==

Coffee will be served around 17:30.

== Preparation ==

'''Note, information is tentative as we're looking into securing
the necessary hardware.'''

We will use the [http://www.makeblock.cc/starter-robot-kit/ Makeblock Robot Starter Kit (Bluetooth)] as a basis, and may add 1-2 additional sensors plus some mechanical parts for increased construction capabilities.

You'll need an Arduino programming environment on your laptop. Details will be described in the coming weeks.

'''Have fun!'''
