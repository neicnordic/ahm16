== Introduction ==

The objective of the two combined sessions is to work in teams
drawing members from different projects in NeIC. You'll get to
build a robot and program it to meet challenges and to compete
against the other teams.

We are planning to split all AHM participants into four teams of
equal size.

Coffee will be served around 17:30.

== Preparation ==

'''Note, information is tentative as we're looking into securing
the necessary hardware.'''

We will use the [[http://www.makeblock.cc/starter-robot-kit/ Makeblock Robot Starter Kit (Bluetooth)]] as a basis, and may add 1-2 additional sensors plus some mechanical parts for increased construction capabilities.

You'll need an Arduino programming environment on your laptop. Details will be described in the coming weeks.

'''Have fun!'''
